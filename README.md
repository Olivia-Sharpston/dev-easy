# Dev Easy ProjectðŸ¦­
## This project was made by Olivia Sharpston, Jaxon Bladow, Corey Butler, and Hayden Carpenter.

#### Everyone had a part that they contributed to for this project. I had gotten the .hmtl and the .script files set up with the array of class facts and other code we needed. Additionally, I had put all of the files together into one repository. Jaxon had added the editting a fact and featuring a random fact. Corey had made it where you could sort the facts from A-Z or Z-A. Hayden has compiled the class facts and drew our wireframe.

#### Here is a piece that Corey had done to sort the class facts in A-Z or Z-A order.
